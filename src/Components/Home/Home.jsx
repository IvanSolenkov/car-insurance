                    Pricing and discounts made up a portion of each insurer’s score,
                    but we know that cost is the top factor for many auto insurance shoppers.
                    Since pricing is based on personal factors including your age, location, vehicle and credit
                    history and gender (in most cases), it’s important to shop around for car insurance quotes.

                        If price is the most important factor in your search,
                        comparing car insurance quotes can help you find the cheapest rate.
                        But your shopping experience will also shed light on a company’s customer service standards.
